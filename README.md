# My Clone of Plants vs Zombies in C++

This repository contains my semester project for the second semester of my computer science studies. The project is a clone of the popular game "Plants vs. Zombies," implemented entirely using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, specifically classes and structs. The project was developed over a span of 20 days as a demonstration of my understanding of OOP.

## Project Overview

### Features:
- **Three Levels**: The game includes three levels, each progressively more challenging.
- **Three Lives per Level**: Players have three lives in each level.
- **Scoring System**: The player's score increases with each level completed.
- **Zombies and Plants**: In each level, zombies attempt to invade the player's house. The player must strategically plant defensive plants to thwart the invasion.
- **SFML for GUI**: The Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) was used to create the graphical user interface for the game.

## Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure the following steps are completed:

1. **Install SFML**:  
   SFML is required to run the graphical user interface of the game. If you do not have SFML installed, follow this tutorial to set it up: [SFML Setup Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzpkvrscs4&authuser=0).

2. **Move Source Files**:  
   Copy all the `.cpp` and `.h` files from the `level`, `plant`, and `zombies` folders into the **main folder** where your `.sln` (solution) file exists. This ensures Visual Studio can find all necessary files to compile and run the project successfully.

### Educational Purpose:
This project was created to apply and test my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming concepts learned during my second semester. The implementation relies solely on classes and structs to manage game mechanics and entities.
