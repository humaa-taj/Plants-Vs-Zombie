# My Clone of Plants vs. Zombies in C++

This repository contains my semester project for the second semester of my computer science studies. The project is a clone of the popular game "Plants vs. Zombies," implemented entirely using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, specifically classes and structs. The project was developed over a span of 20 days as a demonstration of my understanding of OOP.

## Project Overview

### Features:
- **Three Levels**: The game includes three levels, each progressively more challenging.
- **Three Lives per Level**: Players have three lives in each level.
- **Scoring System**: The player's score increases with each level completed.
- **Zombies and Plants**: In each level, zombies attempt to invade the player's house. The player must strategically plant defensive plants to thwart the invasion.
- **SFML for GUI**: The Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) was used to create the graphical user interface for the game.

### Educational Purpose:
This project was created to apply and test my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming concepts learned during my second semester. The implementation relies solely on classes and structs to manage game mechanics and entities.

Thank you for checking out my project! Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback.
